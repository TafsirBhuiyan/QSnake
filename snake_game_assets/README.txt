Enhanced Snake Game - Sound Files

For the full game experience with audio, you'll need to add the following sound files to the snake_game_assets/sounds directory:

1. eat.wav - Sound effect for when the snake eats food
2. game_over.wav - Sound effect for when the game ends
3. powerup.wav - Sound effect for when the snake collects a power-up
4. background.mp3 - Background music for the game

You can find free sound effects on websites like:
- freesound.org
- soundbible.com
- zapsplat.com

The game will still work without these files, but you'll miss out on the audio experience.
